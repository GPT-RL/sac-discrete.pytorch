# SAC-Discrete in PyTorch
This is a PyTorch implementation of SAC-Discrete([Christodoulou. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07207)) with **Prioritized experience replay**([Schaul et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952)) and **Multi-step learning**, which is used in Rainbow([Hessel et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298)).

I refered to some implementations below.
- [Authors's implementation](https://github.com/p-christ/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms-with-PyTorch)(However, without codes for atari's envs.)
- [The implementation of SAC(continuous)](https://github.com/ku2482/soft-actor-critic.pytorch)

## Requirements
You can install liblaries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
